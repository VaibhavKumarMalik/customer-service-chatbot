## Development Setup

Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed. You can check by running:

```bash

npm -v
```

If not installed, download Node.js [here](https://nodejs.org/).

## Running the Application

### Start the Server

To start the development server, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will run the server in development mode. The server will usually be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Run NLP Tasks

To process NLP tasks or start NLP services, use:

```bash
npm run nlp
```

This will handle the necessary NLP operations for the chatbot to understand and process user input.
